# Diagrams (Excalidraw)

This directory contains **diagram sources** (`.excalidraw`) and **rendered exports** (`.svg`) used in the documentation.

Why both?
- `.excalidraw` is the editable source of truth (open it in https://excalidraw.com or the Excalidraw VS Code extension).
- `.svg` is what GitHub can render inline in markdown.

Conventions:
- Keep diagrams **English-only**.
- Prefer **high-level** diagrams here (architecture, trust boundaries, key flows).
- Keep Mermaid in docs for deeply technical, diff-friendly sequence diagrams where it adds value.
